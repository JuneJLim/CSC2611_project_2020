This project shows the possibility of using word embeddings for detecting cultural and social changes. Based on the Canadian Parliamentary debates dataset and focusing on neighborhoods of words in the word2vec models, it attempts to identify diachronic word replacement that happens due to cultural and political changes. In addition, it measures and visualizes the changing similarity among political parties to find evidence for the phenomenon of political polarization. Experiments to choose hyperparameters most suitable for these purposes and preliminary analyses with selected keywords related to social changes and political issues are discussed.

The data needed to build word2vec models can be downloaed at https://www.lipad.ca.
